SOAP Hello World
=======

The SOAP Hello World project uses a single SOAP Endpoint that consists of one operation (sayHelloWorld). This single operation, when called, simply returns the text "Hello World".

Design
======
Single Composite with one Bean Component. The Bean Component (HelloWorldServiceBean) provides the implementation for the Component Service (HelloWorldService). A Single Composite Service is created using a SOAP Binding. The WSDL for the Composite Service was generated by the JBoss SwitchYard Tooling from the HelloWorldService Interface.
